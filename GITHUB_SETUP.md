# GitHub Repository Connection

## ✅ Repository Setup Complete

Your local project has been prepared and connected to: [https://github.com/BertaFly/plants-tracker.git](https://github.com/BertaFly/plants-tracker.git)

## Next Steps to Push Code

Since GitHub authentication is required, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Using Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with repo permissions
3. Use it as password when prompted:
```bash
git push -u origin main
# Username: BertaFly
# Password: <your-personal-access-token>
```

### Option 3: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:BertaFly/plants-tracker.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Ready to Push
